		<p class="paragraph2">What is burnt basque cheesecake? Also called San Sebastian cheesecake, it's been around
			since
			the late 80s when
			it was created by a cook named Santiago Rivera at his restaurant and pintxo bar, La Viña, in San Sebastián,
			Spain. There are a whole bunch of things that set it apart from American-style cheesecakes, the biggest is
			that
			there's no graham crust. In an interview, Rivera explained that when you bite into it, the cookie “prevents
			the
			cream cheese part from dissolving” — he wanted it to be more like chocolate mousse “so the flavor goes
			straight
			from the fork to your palate to your brain, instantaneously.”</p>

	<div class="paragraph3-container">
		<p class="paragraph3">Not only does the cheesecake have no crust, it's often served closer to room temperature,
			so
			it tastes less
			dense. It's slightly flan-like due to the addition of heavy cream. And it is baked at a higher temperature
			so it
			gets a scorched and caramelized top that contrasts gorgeously with the creamy interior. Oh and this is the
			most
			blessed thing — no water bath. Cracks? Sinking centers? Here the rusticity is intentional.</p>

		<h3 class="preparation-head">So what did I need from basque cheesecake that wasn't already out there?</h3>
		<section class="preparation-content">
			<ul class="preparation1">First, I wanted less. Am I the only one who finds cheesecake to always be too much?
				A giant heavy round springform pan of 2 pounds of cream cheese, half a dozen eggs, an hour of baking
				time; it's such a
				commitment. A loaf? Petite, easily sliced, a neat rectangle that fits easily in the bottom of a Sephora
				shopping bag, 45 minutes baking time.</ul>
			<ul class="preparation2">Next, I wanted it quicker, a 5-minute batter, the kind I use for the cheesecake
				bars with all the berries. I
				don't mean 5 minutes once the cream cheese is at room temperature, or 5 minutes once you've measured a
				bunch of things, I mean 5 minutes total. Once I realized a food processor or high-speed blender turns
				cold
				cream cheese into a batter in about 30 seconds, I haven't brought cream cheese to room temperature
				since.</ul>
			<ul class="preparation3">Finally, while most basque cheesecake recipes I've seen use some flour, I saw no
				reason this couldn't be gluten-free and used cornstarch instead. Plus, cornstarch makes for the
				silkiest, most unforgettable
				texture.</ul>
			<p class="preparation4">Believe me, I was tempted to add a cherry syrup or sherry-infused whipped cream
				finish but we've found we
				like the cheesecake best adornment- and frippery-free, exactly like this. Which also means you're going
				to make it twice as often. We can't stop.</p>

	<h2 class="ingredients-head">Ingredients</h2>
	<div class="ingredients-content">
		<ul>2/3 cup (130 grams) granulated sugar</ul>
		<ul>1/3 cup (45 grams) cornstarch</ul>
		<ul>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</ul>
		<ul>1 pound cream cheese (2 8-ounce/227-gram packages) [see Note at end]</ul>
		<ul>3 large eggs</ul>
		<ul>2 teaspoons (10 ml) vanilla extract or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract plus 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste</ul>
		<ul>2 tablespoons (30 ml) lemon juice</ul>
		<ul>1 cup (235 ml) heavy cream</ul>
	</div>
	<h2 class="directions-head">Directions</h2>
	<div class="directions-content">
		<ol>1. Heat oven to 425°F (218°C). Line a loaf pan (see Note at the end about size) with one big piece of
			parchment
			paper pressed into the corners and up the sides. I leave the excess paper extended up over the rim, which
			also
			helps protect you against overflow. Place loaf pan on a rimmed baking sheet, just in case there's overflow
			(but
			I've never had any).</ol>
		<ol>2. In a food processor or high-speed blender: Blend the sugar, cornstarch, and salt into the empty workbowl
			to
			combine. (Make sure the lid is on or the cornstarch will escape in a cloud of dust.) Cut the cold cream
			cheese
			into large chunks and add to the sugar mixture and blend until completely combined and the cream cheese is
			soft,
			scraping down the bowl once or twice. Add eggs, one at a time, and blend to combine then scrape down the
			sides
			of the workbowl (yes, each time). With the third egg, add the vanilla and lemon juice too before blending
			and
			scraping down the sides one more time. Add the cream and blend to evenly combine.</ol>
		<ol>3. With a handmixer: Combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add softened cream cheese
			and beat
			to combine, scraping down the bowl a few times as you do to make sure there's no unmixed cream cheese. Add
			eggs,
			one at a time, beating to combine and scraping down the bowl between each. With the third egg, add the
			vanilla
			and lemon juice too before blending and scraping down the bowl one more time. Pour in the cream, beating on
			low
			speed until combined.</ol>
		<ol>4. All methods: Pour into prepared pan, making sure it all lands inside the parchment paper sling. Transfer
			to oven
			and bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until puffed, deeply golden brown, and moderately jiggly when the pan is
			shimmied. [Mine registered an internal temperature of 190 to 200°F, which is much higher than a typical
			cheesecake but the texture was perfect.]</ol>
		<ol>5. To finish and serve: Transfer cake in loaf pan to a cooling rack and cool at room temperature for 1 to 2
			hours or
			transfer to the fridge and cool for one hour. The cheesecake can be served cool or at room temperature; the
			latter is traditional but both are delicious.</ol>
		<ol>6. Use parchment paper to lift and remove cheesecake from loaf pan and transfer to a plate. Cut into just
			shy of
			1-inch slices.</ol>
		<ol>7. Do ahead: Leftover basque cheesecake keeps in the fridge for 5 to 7 days.</ol>

	<h2 class="notes-head">Notes</h2>
	<section class="notes-content">
		<ul>Cream cheese temperature: For the food processor option, the cream cheese can be cold from the fridge. For
			the
			handmixer, you'll want the cream cheese at room temperature, softened.</ul>
		<ul>Loaf pan size: Since, like my blueberry muffin loaf, pumpkin loaf, and others, this yields a very full loaf
			pan,
			here is my standard disclaimer about loaf pan size: Very key here is the size of your loaf pan because this
			will
			fill out every speck of it before it is done. Mine holds 6 liquid cups (or 1420 ml); it's 8x4 inches on the
			bottom and 9x5 inches on the top. If yours is even slightly smaller or you're nervous, go ahead and scoop
			out a
			little to make a muffin or two on the side. When making this for the first time, place a sheet pan
			underneath,
			just in case it spills over but I can promise you that in many tests, mine never has.</ul>
		<ul>Baking temperature: I tested this many, many times at both 425°F and 450°F and even as of this publication
			moment, I'm torn on the “best” temperature. 450°F will bake in 40 minutes, tops, and has a more dramatically
			dark top. But, not everyone likes theirs that dark. 425°F can take up to 50 minutes and looks the way you
			see it
			here, deeply brown in areas but not throughout. Here's the upshot: If yours doesn't come out as dark as
			you'd
			like it, go for the higher temperature next time.</ul>
		<ul>Chocolate Basque Cheesecake: My husband has been asking for a chocolate version of this forever, and I
			finally
			caved for Father's Day. I didn't expect to love it too, but it was excellent and gone too fast. The
			adjustment
			is simple. I melted 5.5 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate into a splash of the cream, then whisked in rest
			of
			cold cream to cool it to room temperature. Add when you add the cream in the recipe above. I skipped the
			lemon
			juice. The pan is even fuller, so be careful, but mine didn't spill over thanks to the extended sides of the
			sling of parchment paper.</ul>
